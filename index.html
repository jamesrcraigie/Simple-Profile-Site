            <p class="hero-text">The maze uses a concpet known as Procedural Content Generation (PCG), which means they are created using algorithms, so the player will face a new maze with each play. Within the maze the player has to find coloured digits which together provided the key to escape.</p>

        <div class="portfolio-text-container">
            <p class="hero-text">In the main menu, players had the choice of algorithms for the maze generation. Each algorithm provided a slightly varied dynamic to the maze. Most of the algorithms were established, known algorithms for generating maze, but i did write a genetic algorithm for content generation. Genetic algorithms are based on using the Darwinian concept of evolution to find an optimal solution to a given problem. Players could also view a global leaderboard, linked to an API, to see how they faired against players worldwide.</p>
